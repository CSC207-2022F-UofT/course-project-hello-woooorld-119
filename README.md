MILESTONE 4 PULL REQUEST EXPLANATIONS 

ISABEL
1. https://github.com/CSC207-2022F-UofT/course-project-hello-woooorld-119/pull/13
Here, I added the majority of the User class implementation. I believe this was significant as the class is an entity
and is needed in order for the other classes to work. This was the pull request done after writing new methods and 
adding the changes made to implement Storage.  
2. https://github.com/CSC207-2022F-UofT/course-project-hello-woooorld-119/pull/22
This is a more recent pull request, however, I believe my review was significant as I ensured that our group's code is staying consistent throughout 
everyone's parts. This is in terms of method/function names. As well, I asked for reviews on code written based on what the group had previously 
discussed. This is to ensure we are all on the same page with the design of the application and that our logic is clear so there is no confusion. 

Note: I will be writing test cases for Milestone 5 with Nivedha
